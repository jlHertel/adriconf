# Advanced DRI Configurator

adriconf (**A**dvanced **DRI** **CONF**igurator) is a GUI tool used to configure
open source graphics drivers. It works by setting options and writing them to
the standard `drirc` file used by the Mesa drivers.

## Features

The main features of the tool are:

- Automatic removal of invalid and unsupported options.
- Options whose value is identical to the system-wide value or the driver's
  default value will be ignored.
- System-wide application options with redundant options will be
  removed automatically.

## Building

To build from source you can use the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/jlHertel/adriconf.git
    cd adriconf
    mkdir build-dir
    cd build-dir
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install

## Translating

To add a new language or to improve a existing one, you can edit the po files
located under po/ dir.
To add a new translation use the following command (for example for German):

    msginit -i adriconf.pot -o de.po --locale=de

To update an existing translation from the pot file you can use the folowing:

    mv de.po de.po~
    msgmerge -o de.po de.po~ adriconf.pot

To update the pot file itself you can run the following:

    intltool-update --pot --gettext-package=adriconf

Please note that many text shown in the application are from mesa directly,
mainly the option descriptions. Therefore if you see any missing translation
you will need to add it to the [mesa](https://www.mesa3d.org/) project itself.
